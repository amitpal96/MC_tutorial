# Neutrino Monte Carlo Simulator with Apptainer

This repository provides container definition files to build a complete environment for neutrino Monte Carlo simulations using **ROOT**, **GENIE**, and **NuWro** inside Apptainer containers.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- A Linux system with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) installed  
- At least **X GB free disk space**  
- Tarballs of required packages (ROOT, Pythia6, LHAPDF, log4cpp, libxml2, GENIE, etc.)  

👉 All package tarballs are available on Google Drive:  
[Download from Google Drive](YOUR-GOOGLE-DRIVE-LINK)  

After downloading, place all tarballs in a single folder (e.g., `packages/`).

## 🛠️ Step 1: Build the base container

Use `tutorial.def` to create a sandbox called `work_container`:

```bash
apptainer build --sandbox work_container tutorial.def
